Description: 
  Rstudio addins for several common testing-related tasks during package 
  development, such as switching between a source file and an associated test 
  file or running unit tests in a single test file (hotkeyable!). 
  testthis also provides utility function to manage tests in subdirectories of
  the test/testthis directory.
