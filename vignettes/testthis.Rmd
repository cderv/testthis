Testthis provides several tools to make unit testing in R slightly more 
confortable. It is designed to be used in conjunction with testthat package. 
At the moment it provides two sets of features: 

  * Rstudio addins that enable to assign hotkeys to menial tasks
  * A checklist-like test coverage feature, that automatically discovers
    all functions in your package, but requires you to manually mark them
    as "tested"

## Rstudio addins (requires Rstudio)

## Test coverage checklist

```{r}
get_test_coverage(pkg = '~/Dropbox/workspace/r/testthis')
```
